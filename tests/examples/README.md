# Examples using DLScanner

This directory shows examples of uses of DLScanner.
At the moment it only contains the example for the code used in the paper
[Explaining Data Anomalies over the NMSSM Parameter Space with Deep Learning Techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13912)
in the directory [2508_13912](2508_13912).
This is a rather advanced example showing how to implement a dynamical classifier based on a penalty function.

In the future we would like to mention in here other papers that also use DLScanner even if the code is not present.
