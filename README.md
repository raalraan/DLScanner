# Testing

Testing works better inside a virtual environment.
The simplest way to create one is by running:

    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
    # Activate virtual environment
    source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate

Replace `/path/to/new/virtual/environment` with the path
that you want to contain the files for the virtual environment.
For example, `.venv` in the root of this repository.
